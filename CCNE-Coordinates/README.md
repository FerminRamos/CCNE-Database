## Getting Started
Required changes to Geocoding.py file:
1. Grab your own personal API_KEY and insert it onto line #26 (Google's Tutorial: [API_KEY])
2. Modify line #58 so it matches your file names
3. Modify Array (starting on line #91) and add any schools that don't have a specific address. Defaults lat//lng to 0,0.

Make sure to close all files before running the program.
